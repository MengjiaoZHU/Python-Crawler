# Python-Crawler  
* This is my final project for Course "Web Searching", which was finished in May 2015.  
* The function of this web crawler is to dynamically get the events information(including concerts, shows, .etc) from [Damai.cn](http://www.damai.cn)  
* I used Python, Django as framework and Apache Solr to support searching function based on time and location. The crawled data is stored using sqlite.
* I used md5 to compress and encrypt url for duplication checking;
